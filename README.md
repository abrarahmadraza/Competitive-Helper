### Competitive-Helper
Various utilities to help with competitive programming/math. Including, solving recurrences,    
from here: https://github.com/lion137/Linear_Recurrence_Solver.      
Before starts, run prime sieve to 10 milions - to reasonably fast factorize numbers up to ```10^16```. No dependencies, just standard library.              
Functions:
- ```is_prime```;    
- ```divisors(n)``` - all divisors of ```n```;    
-  ```primes(n)``` - primes up to ```n```;    
- ```factorize(n)``` - factors of ```n```;     
- ```distinct_factors(n)```;     
- ```totient(n)``` - Eulers Totient function;     
- ```ndivisors(n)``` - number of divisors of ```n```;     
- ```sdivisors(n)``` - sum of proper divisors;    
- ```lcm(n, m)``` - Least Common Multiple of ```n```, ```m```;     
- ```recurrence(n, vec, vec1)``` - solves recurrence: https://github.com/lion137/Linear_Recurrence_Solver;     
- ```recurrence_mod(n, vec, vec1, mod)``` - solves recurrence modulo;     
- ```pow_mod(a, n, m)``` - power of ```a``` to ```n``` modulo ```m```.     
One can, also, rise a matrix to some power ```n >= 0``` .     
Any suggestions, bugs, comment here or on: https://lion137.blogspot.com/2018/12/competitive-math-helper.html     
Could be use directly in code or as a quick check in console:
